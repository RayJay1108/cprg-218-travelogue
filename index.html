                    The Tent Ridge Horseshoe Trail is one of those hikes that stays with you long after you've finished. If you're up for a challenge, this 12-kilometer loop in Kananaskis Country is an absolute gem. Right from the start, it’s clear that this isn’t a walk in the park—the trail quickly gains elevation, winding through alpine meadows and rocky terrain that requires a bit of scrambling. But the payoff? Absolutely worth it. As you make your way up, the views open up, and soon you’re surrounded by jagged mountain peaks, the hike rewards you with stunning panoramic sights of nearby peaks like Mounts McConnell, Allen, and the Three Point Mountain. Be prepared however for some steep and rocky sections, with a bit of scrambling needed, especially as you near the summit, so it's best suited for those with hiking experience. I highly recomment this Hike as you literally hike about three peaks, each as breathtaking as the others. It was also fun because we met loads of people that made the hard sections worthwhile. Also make sure to bring food as this is a long and harsh trail:)

                        Hiking the Ptarmigan Cirque Trail in October with snow was like stepping into a real-life winter wonderland! At first, it was all golden fall vibes—crunchy leaves underfoot and the sun shining through the trees—but as I got higher, the snow started to creep in, and it was like nature couldn’t decide if it was still autumn or full-blown winter. By the time I reached the top, there was snow everywhere, dusting the peaks, the rocks, and even the trail. It made the whole place look like a snow globe! It felt so peaceful, with hardly anyone else around, and the fresh snow made the air feel super crisp. The view from the summit was totally worth the chilly wind—snow-capped mountains, frozen lakes, and a mix of colorful leaves still hanging on. It was the perfect mix of cozy fall and frosty winter, and it was kind of magical to be in the middle of both seasons at once.

                    <p> Hiking the Rummel Lake Trail was such a fun adventure! From the get-go, the trail had that perfect balance of challenge and beauty. The hike started with some great views of the surrounding mountains and quickly took me through forests of towering trees, with the sound of the wind rustling through the leaves adding to the vibe. As I got closer to the lake, the scenery just kept getting better. Rummel Lake itself was like something out of a postcard—clear, still water reflecting the surrounding peaks like a mirror, and the whole place felt so peaceful and remote. The hike was pretty straightforward, but that final stretch around the lake was amazing, with little spots to pause and take in the view. It was one of those hikes where you feel totally disconnected from the everyday hustle, just soaking in the beauty around you. Definitely one for the books! </p>

                    <p>Hiking the Rummel Lake Trail in late September with my sister and best friend was a total blast! The weather was perfect—not too hot, not too cold—and the fall colors were starting to pop, with the trees turning shades of orange and gold. We spent most of the hike laughing, catching up, and taking way too many photos of the stunning scenery. The trail itself was pretty chill, with just enough uphill to make us feel like we earned that view at the end. When we finally reached the lake, it was absolutely gorgeous—clear, calm water reflecting the snow-capped peaks, and it felt like we had stumbled upon a hidden gem. We took our time, enjoying the peacefulness of the lake and making some silly memories. It was one of those hikes that was as much about the fun company as it was about the amazing scenery—definitely a day I’ll remember! Be warned though as it situated in Lake Louise and starts at Lake Agnes, there are a s#$% ton of tourists and finding parking is near impossible. I suggest getting up early:)</p>
